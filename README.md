Stock Market Application

This is a stock market application where users can filter stocks by name or symbol and view detailed information about individual stocks, including their historical data and real-time price changes.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For client-side scripting.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
Highcharts: A JavaScript library for creating interactive charts.
API Integration
The application fetches stock data from the Twelve Data API. It starts by calling the filtered URL provided in the challenge: https://api.twelvedata.com/stocks?source=docs&exchange=NYSE.

"Users can change the filtered URL by updating the defaultUrl constant in the codebase."

const defaultUrl = "https://api.twelvedata.com/stocks?source=docs";
const startfilteredUrl = "https://api.twelvedata.com/stocks?source=docs&exchange=NYSE";
const url = startfilteredUrl;

const api = {
list: async (): Promise<Share[]> => {
const data = await fetch(url)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((newData) => newData);
if (!(url.length > 43)) {
shares.push(...data.data);
}
return data;
},
};
